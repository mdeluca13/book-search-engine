## Description

The Book Search Engine is a MERN application that allows you to search for a book through Google Books Search and save respective books to your logged in profile. You can view your books at a later time by logging in and clicking See Your Books.

I was able to demonstrate what I have learned throughout the Carleton University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as well as use my researching skills to find and complete this program.
